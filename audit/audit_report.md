# Criterion Breakdown

## Chief Justice Synthesis Engine (Score: 3)
- **Defense** (4): Core philosophy: "Reward Effort and Intent. Look for the Spirit of the Law." I highlight creative workarounds, deep thought, and effort even when implementation is imperfect.
- **Prosecutor** (2): Core philosophy: "Trust No One. Assume Vibe Coding." Applying the 'Trust No One' rule, I treat unverified rubric claims as only partially satisfied. Without hard evidence tied to this criterion, I withhold higher scores.
- **TechLead** (3): Core philosophy: "Does it actually work? Is it maintainable?" Ignore the Vibe and the Struggle; focus on the artifacts. Artifact check: reducer usage in state=no; tool safety / isolation signals=no; critical issues (e.g. linear pipeline, bypassed structure)=yes. Provide a short technical assessment and concrete remediation advice (what to change in code or design).

## Graph Orchestration Architecture (Score: 2)
- **Defense** (4): Core philosophy: "Reward Effort and Intent. Look for the Spirit of the Law." I highlight creative workarounds, deep thought, and effort even when implementation is imperfect.
- **Prosecutor** (1): Core philosophy: "Trust No One. Assume Vibe Coding." If the rubric asks for Parallel Orchestration but the evidence shows a linear pipeline (or missing fan-out/fan-in markers), I argue for a score of 1. I look specifically for bypassed structure (no parallel branches, no synchronization node, no conditional edges). Charges:
- Misleading Architecture Visual / Missing Diagram Proof Specific missing elements I am charging:
- Accurate StateGraph diagram that clearly distinguishes parallel branches from sequential steps.
- **TechLead** (1): Core philosophy: "Does it actually work? Is it maintainable?" Ignore the Vibe and the Struggle; focus on the artifacts. Artifact check: reducer usage in state=no; tool safety / isolation signals=no; critical issues (e.g. linear pipeline, bypassed structure)=yes.

> **Dissent:** High variance detected: Scores range from 1 to 4. Significant conflict between judge perspectives.

## Structured Output Enforcement (Score: 2)
- **Defense** (4): Core philosophy: "Reward Effort and Intent. Look for the Spirit of the Law." I highlight creative workarounds, deep thought, and effort even when implementation is imperfect.
- **Prosecutor** (1): Core philosophy: "Trust No One. Assume Vibe Coding." No structured JudicialOpinion instances are present in state. Under 'Hallucination Liability', I assume Judges are returning freeform text or are not wired with schema enforcement at all. This warrants the lowest possible score. Charges:
- Hallucination Liability (unstructured judge outputs) Specific missing elements I am charging:
- Judge nodes that bind the model to the JudicialOpinion schema (structured output enforcement).
- Validation and retry logic when LLM outputs malformed or free‑form text instead of JSON.
- **TechLead** (3): Core philosophy: "Does it actually work? Is it maintainable?" Ignore the Vibe and the Struggle; focus on the artifacts. Artifact check: reducer usage in state=no; tool safety / isolation signals=no; critical issues (e.g. linear pipeline, bypassed structure)=yes.
